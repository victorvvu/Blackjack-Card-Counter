## 1. Summary 

##### Overview
Card counting is a known blackjack strategy to have the best odds of beating or breaking even against the house.

At a glance, the strategy is just to keep track of low cards (2-6) which is asigned a value of +1, neutral or midding cards (7,8,9) +0, and high cards/aces (10, J, Q, K, A) -1. This allows you to know how many high cards are left in the deck which is advantages to the player and generally worse for the house. This combined with basic blackjack strategy gives a player a huge edge. So for example, if the count is +5, in a deck of 52 cards, then the chances of a high card coming off the top is extremely high. 

Build a object detection model to keep the card "count" in Blackjack.
